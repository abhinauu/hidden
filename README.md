# HIDDEN (Hillslope Diffusion Evolution Networks)
## Introduction
This repository explores hillslope evolution and its dynamics through a diverse range of modeling techniques. In contrast to traditional analytical and numerical methods, modern machine learning and deep learning techniques are leveraged to simulate and predict hillslope evolution driven by diffusive processes. The core objective boils down to using these models to find a (approximate) solution to the diffusion equation governing hillslope evolution.

$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 z}{\partial x^2}$$

where:
- $z(x, t)$ = elevation at position $x$ and time $t$
- $D$ = diffusion coefficient,
- $\frac{\partial^2 z}{\partial x^2}$ = curvature of the slope,
- $t$ = time, and $x$ = spatial coordinate along the hillslope.
